Added Customer class, changed all the packages to match and added a dummy buyCar method just for testing -Kyle

The Code I added partially works. I am still working on them, but they do open other scenes when buttons are clicked. Wanted to post something rather then nothing. The image if for the background in the user and forgot password scene. Sorry for the delay - Sanchez

Added database.sql.  Log into SQL in the directory and type 'source database.sql' to create the database.  Then when you want to make a database connection, create a new Connect object.
